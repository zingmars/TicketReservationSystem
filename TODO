This file is meant to be a reference for the documentation we'll need to write.
These should be implemented for a full system. None of these will be implemented for the prototype.

1. Price validation - price should have only be allowed to have 2 numbers after the decimal point
2. Administrator's user view - Admin should be able to manage the users from within the web app
3. Theatre, performance, user selection should be reworked - a simple dropdown won't scale well into an actual system
4. Ticket viewing/printing functionality

These should probably have been implemented:
1. Search functionality
2. When opening views like performances (from purchases view), theatres (from show view) etc they should have a "Go back" link instead of "Back to list" link.
3. Categories: Adding them to performances, having performances list related categories and having categories list all related performances
