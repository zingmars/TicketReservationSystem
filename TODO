This file is meant to be a reference for the documentation we'll need to write.
These should be implemented for a full system. None of these will be implemented for the prototype.

1. Theatre, performance, user selection should be reworked - a simple dropdown won't scale well into an actual system
2. Ticket viewing/printing functionality
3. The performances view should only list upcoming performances, not all available performances
4. Allow performances to be shared between theatres
5. Administrator's user view - Admin should be able to manage the users from within the web app
6. Payments

These should probably have been implemented, but weren't (yet):
1. When opening detail views for things like performances or theatres, they should have a "Go back" link instead of "Back to list" link if the user came from a different section.
2. Date-time picker for event dates that works with all browsers (Only Blink and MSHTML based browsers support datetime-local inputs generated for these fields)
3. Validation for event date creation (/Pages/Performances/CreateDates.cshtml.cs line 57+)
4. Price validation - price should have only be allowed to have 2 numbers after the decimal point
5. Seat numbers on tickets should be generated in a sequence. Make theatre seat count mandatory (non-nullable). Max ticket count = theatre seat couunt.
6. Search functionality
7. Translate in Latvian
8. Add event date information (selection, viewing) to admin's purchase view
9. Categories: Adding them to performances, having performances list related categories and having categories list all related performances
10. Editing, deleting performance times
