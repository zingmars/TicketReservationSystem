This file is meant to be a reference for the documentation we'll need to write.
These should be implemented for a full system. None of these will be implemented for the prototype.

1. Price validation - price should have only be allowed to have 2 numbers after the decimal point
2. Administrator's user view - Admin should be able to manage the users from within the web app
3. Theatre, performance, user selection should be reworked - a simple dropdown won't scale well into an actual system
4. Ticket viewing/printing functionality
5. The performances view should only list upcoming performances
6. Search functionality
7. Allow events to be shared between theatres
8. Rename performance to something more fitting (i.e. event)

These should probably have been implemented, but wasn't:
1. When opening views like performances (from purchases view), theatres (from show view) etc they should have a "Go back" link instead of "Back to list" link.
2. Categories: Adding them to performances, having performances list related categories and having categories list all related performances
3. The "Buy a ticket" link in performance's date view should auto-select the performance and the selected date
4. Editing, deleting performance times
5. Date-time picker for event dates that works with all browsers (Only Blink and MSHTML based browsers support datetime-local inputs generated for these fields)
6. Validation for event date creation
7. Add event date information (selection, viewing) to admin's purchase view
