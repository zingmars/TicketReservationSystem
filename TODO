These should be implemented for a full system. None of these will be implemented for the prototype

1. Price validation - price should have only be allowed to have 2 numbers after the decimal point
2. Administrator's user view - Admin should be able to manage the users from within the web app
3. Theatre, performance, user selection should be reworked - a simple dropdown won't scale well into an actual system
