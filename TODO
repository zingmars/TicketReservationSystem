This file is meant to be a reference for the documentation we'll need to write.
These should be implemented for a full system. None of these will be implemented for the prototype.

1. Theatre, performance, user selection should be reworked - a simple dropdown won't scale well into an actual system
2. Ticket viewing/printing functionality
3. The performances view should only list upcoming performances, not all available performances
4. Allow performances to be shared between theatres
5. Administrator's user view - Admin should be able to manage the users from within the web app
6. Payments
7. Date-time picker for event dates that works with all browsers (Only Blink and MSHTML based browsers support datetime-local inputs generated for these fields)
8. Admins should be able to see all tickets for a particular event date
9. Fix pages with input fields not repopulating some hidden fields after errorneous input
10. Any leftover TODO items in the code (do full directory search to find them).

These should probably have been implemented, but weren't (yet):
1. Search functionality [ Basic JS frontend search in each of the index (list) pages is good enough for the prototype ]
2. Categories: Adding them to performances, performances should list related categories and having categories list all related performances [ Similar to how dates work ]
3. Translate to Latvian
